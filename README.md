# A Convolutional Neural Network Dog Breed Classifier

## Overview
This project analyzes several different CNN models for their ability to to recognize and identify dogs and humans. As input this project uses a custom [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip) and a custom [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) - both provided by Udacity. This work was done to complete a project for the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree (AIND). The original project instructions can be found in the `Project_Instructions.md` file.

## Usage
To run the project open and execute the dog app Jupyter Notebook. In the terminal execute:

`jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb`

This project is designed to be run on a Computer containing a Nvidia GPU compatible with Tensorflow. Running this project only on a CPU will likely take a prohibitively long time.
